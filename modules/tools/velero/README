# Introduction

Velero (https://velero.io/) is an open source solution for performing backup in K8s clusters. Velero (formerly known as Heptio ArK) is now owned by VMware.

Velero backs up objects in a K8s namespace and can also backup cluster-scoped objects (PVs) associated to those namespace objects.

Velero use a volume snapshotter plugin (eg. AES EBS, Azure Disk, vSphere Volume) to snapshot persistent volumes during backup operations. 

If you need an application-consistent backup, Velero supports pre- and post- hooks to put databases or other workloads in an consistent state before a snapshot is tokane.

You can interact with Velero using CLI ('brew install velero') or via API objects in K8s. 

# Creating a Backup Schedule

Backup schedules can be created using the Velero "Schedule" API type and described in a cron format. We will use a Helm chart to contain all Schedule API resources.

# Performing One-time backups

Performing a one-time backup prior to a maintenance activity can be done via Velero CLI or by creating a YAML manifest.

eg) velero backup create <backup name> --snapshot-volumes=true --include-namespaces <namespace>

# Checking backup status

eg) velero get backups
eg) velero backup describe <backup name>
eg) velero backup logs <backup name>

# Performing Restores

eg) velero create restore --from-schedule <backup schedule name>
eg) velero create restore --from-backup <backup name>
eg) velero create restore --from-backup <backup name> --namespace <original namespace>:<restore namespace>
